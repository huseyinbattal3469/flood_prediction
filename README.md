# Flood Probability Prediction using Neural Networks

This project is based on a Kaggle competition [Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 5](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e5/overview) that focuses on predicting flood probability. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, with an emphasis on fine-tuning for performance.

## Project Files

- `train.csv`: The training dataset containing features and flood probability labels.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset used for generating predictions.
- `sample_submission.csv`: A sample submission file provided by Kaggle to format the prediction results.
- `main.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook from which this preprocessing, training, evaluating and creating submission file.
- `submission.csv`: The final submission file generated by the model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the probability of flooding based on various environmental and infrastructural factors. The model uses a Sequential neural network with dense layers, trained on the provided dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### Data Preprocessing

- Combined training and test datasets for consistent preprocessing.
- Created new features `Ratio1` and `Ratio2` derived from the existing features.
- Scaled the data using `RobustScaler` to handle outliers and ensure a uniform scale across features.

### Model Architecture

- **Dense Layer 1**: 64 units, ReLU activation.
- **Dense Layer 2**: 32 units, ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer**: 1 unit, linear activation for regression.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and a mean squared error loss function. A custom R^2 score metric is also used to evaluate model performance.

### Model Training

- **Batch Size**: 1024
- **Epochs**: 100
- The model is trained on the training set, with evaluation on the same set due to the absence of a validation split in this script.

### Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the R^2 score and loss on the training set. The best model based on these metrics is saved and used for generating predictions on the test set.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Training Script On**:
   ```bash
   main.ipynb
   ```
   This will train the model and save the predictions in `submission.csv`.

2. **Submit Predictions**:
   Upload `submission.csv` to the Kaggle competition to evaluate the model's performance.
